# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction---Jupyter-Notebook
The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

Attribute Information

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

We set an arbitrary cutoff for your dependent variable (wine quality) at e.g. 7 or higher getting classified as 'good/1' and the remainder as 'not good/0' so that we can do hyper parameter tuning and get ROC curve and the AUC value
